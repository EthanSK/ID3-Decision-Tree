# Simple Decision Tree model generator using ID3 algorithm

Very unpolished and simple, but works for any categorical data (not just binary features and labels).

The purpose of this script is to show calculations for uncertainty and information gain at each step.

To use, just put your data in csv format with the final column as the labels.
